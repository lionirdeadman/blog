I create projects in my spare time in JavaScript and [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org/) using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org). I also have a cat named "Puss", who I `interface` with regularly
You can read more about me [here](/about).

## Languages

I am currently having a *fling* with JavaScript. I use it "on the daily" to develop programs, so I'm very used to how it works and feels. I am very used to JavaScript, TypeScript and the NodeJS system, so I know my way around it quite well. You can keep up with my projects [here](https://github.com/resynth1943)

## Environment

I would also like to say that I use Linux for my development environment. To be more specific, I find openSUSE to be a coherent, configurable and easy-to-use distro. In addition, I can get my work done efficiently while using it. As my code editor, I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for the same reasons I use openSUSE. As for my desktop setup, I am currently using a nice Solarized theme with a few extensions to help me work.

## How to reach me

I have a Twitter account, which is available [here](https://twitter.com/resynth1943). If you need to contact me via email, my email is [resynth1943@outlook.com](mailto:resynth14943@outlook.com).
