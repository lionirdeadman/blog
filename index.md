# resynth1943

The adventures of Resynth, the JavaScript (99% TypeScript) developer and former YouTuber. Also fighting alongside you until it's acceptable; privacy matters.

## Languages

I am currently having a *fling* with JavaScript. I use it "on the daily" to develop programs, so I'm very used to how it works and feels. I am very used to JavaScript, TypeScript and the NodeJS system, so I know my way around it quite well. You can keep up with my projects [on my GitHub page](https://github.com/resynth1943).

## Environment

I would also like to say that I use Linux for my development environment. To be more specific, I find openSUSE to be a coherent, configurable and easy-to-use distro. In addition, I can get my work done efficiently while using it. As my code editor, I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for the same reasons I use openSUSE. As for my desktop setup, I am currently using a nice Solarized theme with a few extensions to help me work.
