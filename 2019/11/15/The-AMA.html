<h1 id="the-ama">The AMA</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I have recently been the subject of an AMA (Ask me Anything). Here is an archive of the questions / answers that happened in the AMA.</p>

<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>

<h3 id="whats-your-favourite-linux-distribution">What’s your favourite Linux distribution?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>I currently am in love with openSUSE Tumbleweed. openSUSE Leap has some old packages, like Firefox ESR, which don’t have functionality like custom elements, so I’ve opted for Tumbleweed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="how-you-did-find-your-way-into-penguin-land-linux">How you did find your way into “penguin land” (Linux)?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I first tried experimenting with Linux Mint on my Macbook Pro 2015 (this goes back a while). I enjoyed getting away from MacOS more, which is probably why I was such a fan of Bootcamp (installs Windows on a Mac) and I partially liked the *buntu experience. I didn’t know much about Linux at the time (I thought it was just one… OS), but I’ve learned a lot. It’s definitely been a worthwhile experience.
I’ve found that Windows offers more gaming capabilities, and is slightly better catered to the gaming community, which explains why it may be such a rarity over there, but Linux is ever so slowly catching up, from what I can see, with systems like PlayOnLinux offering an easy-to-use UI for playing games on Linux. I think this is a great idea, and one that should be encouraged.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="did-you-learn-js-first">Did you learn JS first?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Correct! I first learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I resent being called a Full-Stack Developer (it’s a boring buzzword). I had some ups and downs with JavaScript (“why the fuck isn’t this posting to the motherfucking console”), but it’s been a pretty good experience. I think the ECMA could and should definitely introduce new features faster than they currently do, though.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="how-did-you-learn-js-in-particular">How did you learn JS in particular?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I started learning JavaScript with CodeCademy. I remember liking the simplicity of the DOM API, and I recall using jQuery (which was a beginner’s mistake). I just kept writing JavaScript, and I got into it. After some annoyances with it which were due to my confusion with the language, I got into writing it more and more. I then moved on to Node.js, and at that point I though 100 LoC was amazing (I was making a Discord bot)…  Why am I embarrassing myself here :D . I was forced into actually learning the language though, and after a few years, here I am. I’m still where I began, in a sense. I’m looking at the source code of my Discord bot right now :D</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="which-animal-is-your-favourite">Which animal is your favourite?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>My favourite animal would have to be the cat. I have a cat named Puss.
<img src="/assets/images/puss-1.jpg" alt="My Cat &quot;Puss&quot;" /></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="whats-your-least-favourite-linux-distribution-and-why">What’s your least favourite Linux distribution and why?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>My least favourite distribution would have to be Linux Mint. Despite the fact I started out using it, I really dislike how it comes with it’s own desktop environment and other specific things. I like a distribution that lets you choose your Desktop Environment, too, hence my love for openSUSE. openSUSE has an option for installing no Desktop Environment, and you can tell the installer which systemd target you want to be the default too. I like customization like this, but not to the point it’s a bottleneck.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="what-are-your-top-5-favourite-programming-languages-and-why">What are your top 5 favourite programming languages and why?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>My favourite languages would have to be (in order):</p>

  <ul>
    <li>TypeScript (a superset of JavaScript)</li>
    <li>Python, as it seems to be good for data from the small amount I’ve used it</li>
    <li>F# - I really like how it feels. I’m slowly starting to like the .NET ecosystem.</li>
    <li>HTML and CSS - I can use these, but I’m not sure how I feel about using them too much.</li>
    <li>[Plain] JavaScript - Yes, you read that right. I do not enjoy using JavaScript without TypeScript.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<!-- why did i add this one -->

<h3 id="how-are-you">How are you?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m fine, thanks :) Hope you’re well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="whats-your-favourite-video-game">What’s your favourite video game?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>My favourite video game would currently have to be Grand Theft Auto 4. I don’t play many games, but I really like the atmosphere that game provides, and the sounds. Everything about GTA 4 feels slightly retro.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="amd-or-nvidia">AMD or NVIDIA?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I haven’t really had an AMD card. I’ve just got this gaming computer with the specs below.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="thoughts-on-freelibre-software-copyleft-vs-permissive-licenses">Thoughts on free/libre software, copyleft vs permissive licenses?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m not really sure about that one. I haven’t been exploring licensing much unfortunately.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="what-does-your-nickname-resynthified-stand-for">What does your nickname, Resynthified, stand for?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I come up with nicknames pretty well, and the ones I come up with are unique. I chose the number 1943 as it’s the year of Tesla’s birthdate, but I’m not sure where Resynth came from. Resynthified is a spin of Resynth, it doesn’t stand for anything, it’s just a… variance, I would say.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="between-google-apple-and-ms-which-one-do-you-prefer-the-most-and-why">Between Google, Apple and MS, which one do you prefer the most, and why?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I definitely don’t prefer Apple. I think I’m starting to like how Microsoft seems to be encouraging open-source nowadays. This has really improved in comparison to their old thinking model, but I can’t tell if this is just for marketing, and as justification for buying GitHub. I think if I had to choose, I’d choose Microsoft, as Google record a lot of your data, which you can view on your Dashboard.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-like-raspberry-pis-if-so-what-linux-distribution-would-you-install-on-them">Do you like Raspberry Pis? If so, what Linux distribution would you install on them?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I definitely do like Raspberry Pis. I used one for hosting my Discord bot before. It has Raspbian on it, which I was pretty happy with. The system seemed pretty stable, and I quite like how small and extensible the RPi is.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’d like the concept of DIY (build it yourself) introduced to other systems like openSUSE. Building things yourself (from what I’ve read) can give performance advantages, and the packages can be more tailored to your system.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-you-like-about-the-nodejsnpmtypescript-ecosystem">What do you like about the NodeJS/NPM/TypeScript ecosystem?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t like NPM or Node in it’s current state. I love how TypeScript functions though, it feels very natural to me with it’s interfaces and such.
As previously said, I really don’t like using JavaScript on it’s own. I can also live with the NPM ecosystem, but I’ve been using GitLab for hosting my packages lately (https://gitlab.com/resynth1943).
I really do like JavaScript up to a point. I mainly use Node.js (serverside JavaScript) nowadays, though.</p>

<h3 id="what-phone-do-you-have-and-did-you-tinker-with-it-installed-custom-roms-etc">What phone do you have, and did you tinker with it (installed custom ROMs, etc)?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I currently have a Pixel 2 XL. I have not “tinkered” with it though, in the sense of modifiying the system. I mainly use the phone for taking pictures, though :D</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="what-are-your-thoughts-about-androids-evolution">What are your thoughts about Android’s evolution?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think Android has improved in some ways, and gone back in others. I don’t like how the impression is given that it’s so “open-source”, as many, if not all, phones come with a large amount of closed-source software from Google. I hope Google encourages a more open-source market soon, though, that would be nice.
I also don’t like how Google is so up Apple’s arse. A lot of the features of an iPhone have been copied over onto Google’s flagship.</p>

<h3 id="would-you-use-a-linux-phone-as-a-daily-driver">Would you use a Linux phone as a daily driver?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’d be open to using one if they have a good ecosystem and weren’t going to die soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="do-you-have-any-thoughts-on-installing-custom-roms-on-your-phone">Do you have any thoughts on installing custom ROMs on your phone?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wouldn’t be opposed to it in the slightest.
In fact, I tried installing Cynanogen on an old Android. I think a custom ROM could provide more freedom to the user, in the sense that Google dominates phones with their non-FOSS data-collecting apps, e.g Google Play, and many other apps phones come loaded with, like Facebook. I think including Facebook with a phone is ridiculous though.
In short, I definitely would like to explore this more. Custom ROMs seem to embrace FOSS more (most, anyway), and I think that’s definitely a good thing.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-you-like-to-cook-also-cheese-or-no-cheese">What do you like to cook? Also, cheese or no cheese?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>1: Yeah, sometimes. I can bake up a good pasta, and I like eggs too. Eggs are pretty easy to cook. Sometimes I’m lazy and just throw a pizza in the halogen oven, though.
2: Definitely cheese :)</p>

<h3 id="are-you-planning-to-get-into-systems-programming-languages">Are you planning to get into systems programming languages?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you mean C[++], I’ve definitely looked into using those for making applications.
The only thing that slightly put me off was the lack of a boolean type.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="what-programming-language-that-youve-been-tried-outside-jsts">What programming language that you’ve been tried outside JS/TS?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have played with F#, I really really like the syntax and how currying works. It got me into FP, but my use with it has definitely dipped unfortunately. I’d like to start using it again. I was thinking of making Rebot’s [web?] UI with it :-)
Here’s a – hopefully correct – sample of F#:</p>

<h3 id="what-oss-projects-that-youve-been-contributed-to-gnome-project-kde-project-or-something-else">What OSS projects that you’ve been contributed to? GNOME Project, KDE Project or something else?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh no, nothing on that scale unfortunately, but I have contributed to FOSS projects quite often, the activity is on my <a href="https://github.com/resynth1943">GitHub</a>.
My most active FOSS project isn’t FOSS yet though, I don’t release unusable products.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="vim-or-emacs">Vim or Emacs?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would choose Vim, as I’ve used it a lot more than I’ve used Emacs. I actually do use Vim sometimes for a quick little edit, although I wouldn’t say I use it on the daily.</p>
